## ‚ö° Notes / Tips

1. `K` opens hover info ‚Äî you can also map it to a floating preview with LSP.
2. Diagnostics jumps (`[d` / `]d`) work **across the buffer**.
3. `<leader>` in bootstrap.nvim defaults to `\` unless you changed it.
4. Telescope keybinds are optional but extremely handy for workspace-wide navigation.

This is a **ready-to-use reference** ‚Äî you can keep it open while learning LSP in Neovim.

If you want, I can also create a **‚Äúone-page Vim motions + LSP + splits + terminal cheatsheet‚Äù** specifically tailored to bootstrap.nvim so you have all your essentials in one place. It would cover editing, navigation, LSP, terminals, splits, and relative line jumps.  

Do you want me to do that?
